# Direct Imaging using GAN and CNN

# Problem Description

   Deformation of Direct Imaging telescope over time is difficult to model and hence finding the planetary companion by suppressing the speckle pattern is very challenging task. 

# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

   CNN can help to solve this problem by extracting the features of the image and classifying them explaining which one has planet and which one has not. This can be done efficiently only when the two classes of image data (one with planet and the other without) are present in significant numbers to train them. But unfortunately, we have very few confirmed planets, thus less image data (one having planetary companion) and here is where GAN's can help.

# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

  GAN's are creative Neural Network technique which are highly used to create images which resemble close to the fed input images.

Each tile in the image below represents the 28x28 pixel of image generated by GAN. In the left most figure, input noise is given as input for GAN. In the centre figure, one could see GAN generates data resembling the Direct Imaging data. In the right most figure, after several iterations, GAN can now create images resembling the Direct Imaging data.
